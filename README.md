==========

Material for a workshop at FUxCon 2013 about Behat specifications and implementations in CakePHP 2, Django 1.5, Drupal 7 and Symfony 2. Please have a look at its [website](https://cocomore.github.io/fuxcon2013) for background information. 

The framework implementations have their own repositories. This should make it easier to add new implementations or to only look at those that interest you. The repositories are:

* [CakePHP](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_cakephp)
* [Django](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_django)
* [Drupal](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_drupal)
* [Symfony](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_symfony)
