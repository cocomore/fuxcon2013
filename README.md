FUxCon 2013 // The Behat Tests
==============================

Material for a workshop at FUxCon 2013 about Behat specifications and implementations in CakePHP 2, Django 1.5, Drupal 7 and Symfony 2. Please have a look at its [website](https://cocomore.github.io/fuxcon2013) for background information. 

The framework implementations have their own repositories. This should make it easier to add new implementations or to only look at those that interest you. The repositories are:

* [CakePHP](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_cakephp)
* [Django](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_django)
* [Drupal](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_drupal)
* [Symfony](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_symfony)

To prepare and run these tests, as a quick start, 

1. Run the script install.sh in this directory. 

2. Run the tests by calling 

    bin/behat
 

Please refer to our website http://cocomore.github.io/fuxcon2013 for background information. You may also want to try the disk image with a minimal Debian Linux system we provide through this website. This image has all four framework implementations and all necessary software pre-installed.

Happy coding,
