The three Model-View-Controller frameworks in this comparison keep their configuration in files. Drupal traditionally takes a different approach in the much of its configuration resides in the database. While this is nice for small sites, it needs special care when setting up a more complex environment, consisting of multiple developers' seats and staging environments in addition to the live site.   

## CakePHP
{% include cakephp/02-configuration.md %}

## Django
{% include django/02-configuration.md %}

## Drupal
{% include drupal/02-configuration.md %}

## Symfony
{% include symfony/02-configuration.md %}
