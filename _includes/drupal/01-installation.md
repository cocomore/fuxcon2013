Drupal is very conveniently installed and managed using its command line tool drush. Drush can be used to install the core system as well as install and update all required modules. It is also used for day-to-day tasks like clearing cache, creating backups or running cron jobs. 

The installation steps are described in its [README](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_drupal#readme).

You can get the code for this implementation from its [github repository](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_drupal/).

The repository contains a simple install script that loads all required components and sets up a simple demo configuration. Please follow the instructions in the file [README.md](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_drupal#readme) contained in the repository.

There is also a virtual appliance based on VirtualBox which you can install for free locally on your computer or host on the web. This appliance has a website for each of the four web framworks readily installed. Please ask me about the appliance [at the workshop](http://fuxcon.de) or [contact me](http://www.cocomore.com/contact) directly.
