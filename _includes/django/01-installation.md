Django follows the Python philosophy of having batteries included. However, even for our small project we need to install some additional extensions so using a package manager is a good idea. The Python world has homed in on the virtualenv tool for that. 

Once Django is installed, a command line tool manage.py is used for all tasks like starting a development server or performing database migrations. 

The installation steps a re described in its [README](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_django#readme).

You can get the code for this implementation from its [github repository](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_django/).
