Symfony's signature feature is that it entirely consists of independent bundles. A package manager is therefore essential for its installation. Symfony's console tool is app/console. It can be used to clear cache or to generate CRUD code, amongst other functions. I used composer for the installation as described in in its [README](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_symfony#readme). 

You can get the code for this implementation from its [github repository](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_symfony/).
