I downloaded CakePHP from the website http://cakephp.org and prepared it as described in its [README](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_cakephp#readme). 

You can get the code for this implementation from its [github repository](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_cakephp/). 

The repository contains a simple install script that loads all required components and sets up a simple demo configuration. Please follow the instructions in the file [README.md](https://github.com/cocomore/fuxcon2013_cakephp#readme) contained in the repository.

There is also a virtual appliance based on VirtualBox which you can install for free locally on your computer or host on the web. This appliance has a website for each of the four web framworks readily installed. Please ask me about the appliance [at the workshop](http://fuxcon.de) or [contact me](http://www.cocomore.com/contact) directly.
